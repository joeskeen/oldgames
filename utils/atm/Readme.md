# Another Task Manager (ATM)

This file is an installer for Another Task Manager (ATM). I downloaded it from here: <https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/another_task_manager.html>

This is very useful when you are trying to inspect which processes are running, as Windows 98 doesn't have any great built-in tools for that.
