# `sed` (MS-DOS version)

`sed` is a command-line file editing utility. Although part of Unix, someone ported it to MS-DOS. This directory contains the precompiled MS-DOS binary.

It is included in this repository because the [original website](http://pement.org/sed/), although available, has dead links to the binary. This binary 
was acquired by using the Wayback Machine on the Internet Archive to find a version of the author's website where the links were still active. The
direct download link to that binary is here: <https://web.archive.org/web/20130807053143if_/http://pement.org/sed/sed15x.zip>

I do not take any credit or responsibility for this binary. I am simply providing it here for convenience.
